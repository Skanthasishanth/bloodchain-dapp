# bloodchain-dapp

Decentralized blood bank management system using Ethereum smart contracts and React dApp.

## 🩸 BloodChain – Blockchain-based Blood Bank System

### 🚀 Project Overview

**BloodChain** is a decentralized blood bank platform that uses Ethereum smart contracts to ensure transparency, traceability, and trust in the blood donation and distribution process.

Built using:

* ✅ Solidity for smart contracts
* ✅ React.js for the frontend
* ✅ Web3.js for blockchain interaction
* ✅ MetaMask for wallet connection
* ✅ QRCode for blood unit tracking


### 🎯 Problem It Solves

Traditional blood banks rely on centralized, error-prone systems that lack traceability and data integrity. BloodChain stores every donor registration, blood unit, and usage event on the blockchain, making the process tamper-proof and fully transparent.

### 🔧 How to Run the Project Locally

```bash
git clone
cd bloodbank-dapp
npm install --legacy-peer-deps
npm start
```

### 📌 Smart Contract Features

* Register Donors
* Collect Blood
* Issue & Track Blood Units
* QR Code Generation for unit ID
* View Unit Status via Smart Contract
